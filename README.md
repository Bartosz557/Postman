# Postman
Postman REST API request exercise.

The first collection contains requests for the:
https://developers.thecatapi.com/view-account/ylX4blBYT9FaoVd6OhvR?report=bOoHBz-8t
I tested uploading data to the database via HTTP requests with POST methods, fetching them from the database via GET methods, and deleting specific records via DELETE method.
I chose that API because of all 3, GET, POST, and DELETE method availability in a single API, so I could test all the methods and operations on the same data.
The second collection contains requests for another project:
https://github.com/Bartosz557/FinancialManager_BE
The collection tests registration, login, delete account, and checking the authentication methods via POST, GET, and DELETE request methods.
